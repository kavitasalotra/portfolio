I recently went to the mountains with my friends. We were celebrating 50 years of friendship. It was very special. Six of us were to be together spending time in the mountains.

I had never been to that place nor heard of the name. I was told by my friends that they had done all the bookings. I had to just pack and join them at the station

We would be going to _[‘Kumarsain’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumarsain) which is at the foothill of[ Kotgarh](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/shimla/kotgarh.html). Both are growing areas of apples, pears, apricots, almonds, cherries, and plums in Himachal Pradesh._

We were to go on the fast train called Shatabdi from Delhi to Kalka and the onward journey would be in an SUV called an Innova.

We reached Kalka and the cab was waiting for us. We were excited souls. We reached the mountains at 8.30 PM after a long and arduous journey and were even wondering whether it was worth it.

We reached our destination. It was calm quiet with the soft rustling winds whistling through the trees.

### What are the lessons learned?

The lessons about happiness that we learned from the people of the Kumarsain Village were the following:

- To greet people with a lovely smile even though there is some inconvenience to you.

* To make people feel welcome when they come to your house.
* To have a common purpose in life. Community work shared with the purpose of being useful to other people helps in bringing happiness to your life.
* Whatever you do in life requires patience to bring fruits to the effort made by you. Wait with patience to get rewards.
* To spread love and happiness in the lives of people.
* Being respectful towards elders and good exchanges between younger and old generations always helps in personal growth.
* To live in a stress-free environment take a retreat in the mountains where you do not require anything but love and fresh air to live a good life.
* Longevity is when life has less stress and more fun.
