I recently went to the mountains with my friends. We were celebrating 50 years of friendship. It was very special. Six of us were to be together spending time in the mountains.

I had never been to that place nor heard of the name. I was told by my friends that they had done all the bookings. I had to just pack and join them at the station

<br />

We would be going to _[‘Kumarsain’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumarsain) which is at the foothill of[ Kotgarh](https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/incredibleindia/en/destinations/shimla/kotgarh.html). Both are growing areas of apples, pears, apricots, almonds, cherries, and plums in Himachal Pradesh._

We were to go on the fast train called Shatabdi from Delhi to Kalka and the onward journey would be in an SUV called an Innova.

- **Clear**:
- Just as modern architecture thrives on clear and clean lines,
  so does brand architecture. In the age of micro-segmentation, micro-targeting, information
  overload and digital fragmentation, you need a clear and loud voice in order to stand
  out. In the context of short attention spans where specific moments and needstates
  need to be targeted in addition to consumer/customer profiles, multiple brands often
  lead to confusion.

<br />

- **Meaningful**:
- Just as modern architecture prioritizes function over embellishments, a solid brand architecture
  is founded on brands and values meaningful to consumers (or customers), rather than
  product feature distinctions. Brand architecture needs to be re-organized around
  brands that have a “reason for being” compelling enough to elicit passion, and introducing
  a clear distinction between brands that merit air time with consumers vs. “clutter”.

> > Much as strategy has become “real time” as the window for strategic planning has shortened, brand architecture is also becoming more “real time”, requiring more frequent reassessment, adaptations and flexibility as markets change. Witness the frequency with which Uber readjusts its portfolio. WeWork, the popular co-working space, also exploits the strength of the master brand to stretch into near-in categories such as hospitality with WeLive or the ventures space with WeWork Labs.

<br />

- **Stretchable**:

- Modern architecture is dynamic — it finds its force
  in the midst of usage; movement is often embedded into its very bones. In
  today’s fast-changing world, brand architecture is a moving target — clients
  increasingly ask to design architectures that fit their growth ambitions,
  thinking through future growth scenarios and architecting space for the future
  product pipeline.
