How do we become better every single day? We develop practices that will help move us incrementally forward. Small steps, taken consistently. This is the path to a good life.

> _“Seneca gives a pretty simple prescription for the good life. “Each day,” he wrote, “acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes, as well and after you have run over many thoughts, select one to be thoroughly digested that day.” One gain per day. That’s it.”,[- Ryan Holiday](https://forge.medium.com/all-you-need-are-a-few-small-wins-every-day-f1a6d2bf9fb3)_

While routines can be important for consistency and productivity, what is even more important is our practices. These are things we do, no matter what our routine looks like, no matter if something comes up that derails us.
But we need to start small and make sure our practices are sustainable. The idea is to take small but consistent steps, every single day — 1% improvement.

> _“Success is not a destination. Success is a decision you make on a daily, hourly, and even moment-to-moment basis.” — Nicolas Cole_

Epictetus called this incremental action “fueling the habit bonfire.”

Focus on the following 10 practices, and you will begin to see consistent improvement in your life.

#### 1. Meditate

Meditation is number one for a reason.

While I know we’ve all heard we should meditate, I truly believe it is key to moving forward every single day.

Having this self-awareness is the first step toward growth. If you don’t know yourself, how can you expect to make meaningful progress?

Develop a regular meditation practice by following these 4 steps:

- **Start small**:Aim for 5 minutes, or even just one minute if you think that’s all you can commit to. The idea is to commit to a length of time you can do consistently — ideally every single day.
- **Decide on a time of day to practice**:Deciding on a time and doing your meditation at the same time each day makes it much more likely you’ll do it consistently.
- **Commit to this practice**: While each session of meditation does produce benefits on its own, the real magic of meditation comes from consistent practice, and compounds over time.
- **Utilize supports** :There are so many ways to support your practice. One of the most accessible supports is a meditation app. While using an app may not seem like “traditional” meditation, it can be incredibly helpful, especially when you’re starting out.
