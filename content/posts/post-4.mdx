Simply understood, brand architecture is the art and science of structuring the portfolio
to meet your strategic goals, defining the brand number, scope, and relationships
needed to compete. Just as Modern Architecture prioritized function, a Brand Architecture
is only as good as it is well-suited for the purpose it strives to achieve.

#### **There are 3 key imperatives to build this type of brand architecture — to be clear, meaningful and stretchable.**

<br />

- **Clear**:
- Just as modern architecture thrives on clear and clean lines,
  so does brand architecture. In the age of micro-segmentation, micro-targeting, information
  overload and digital fragmentation, you need a clear and loud voice in order to stand
  out. In the context of short attention spans where specific moments and needstates
  need to be targeted in addition to consumer/customer profiles, multiple brands often
  lead to confusion.

<br />

- **Meaningful**:
- Just as modern architecture prioritizes function over embellishments, a solid brand architecture
  is founded on brands and values meaningful to consumers (or customers), rather than
  product feature distinctions. Brand architecture needs to be re-organized around
  brands that have a “reason for being” compelling enough to elicit passion, and introducing
  a clear distinction between brands that merit air time with consumers vs. “clutter”.

> > Much as strategy has become “real time” as the window for strategic planning has shortened, brand architecture is also becoming more “real time”, requiring more frequent reassessment, adaptations and flexibility as markets change. Witness the frequency with which Uber readjusts its portfolio. WeWork, the popular co-working space, also exploits the strength of the master brand to stretch into near-in categories such as hospitality with WeLive or the ventures space with WeWork Labs.

<br />

- **Stretchable**:

- Modern architecture is dynamic — it finds its force
  in the midst of usage; movement is often embedded into its very bones. In
  today’s fast-changing world, brand architecture is a moving target — clients
  increasingly ask to design architectures that fit their growth ambitions,
  thinking through future growth scenarios and architecting space for the future
  product pipeline.
