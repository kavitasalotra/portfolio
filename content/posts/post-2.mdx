In a world of back-to-back meetings, hellish commutes, and cramped workspaces, we have normalized serious issues like burnout, depression, and anxiety.

Our reasons? Productivity and hustle. But the irony—it’s precisely by taking care
of our minds that we become manifold effective and keep burnout at bay. To quote

A Steamy Shower with A Scented Body Wash

May God bless the person who invented the showerhead — a hot shower is my omnipotent “reset” button.

Procrastinated for 2 hours? Lacking the motivation to write? Feeling lethargic? No matter what, post a hot shower, I’m a machine.

Hot showers have a ton of benefits — better sleep, healthier skin, reduced headaches, relieved bodily tension, and stress evaporation. With a scented body wash or oil, this climbs up another notch.

If you’re looking for a jolt of mental energy and alertness rather than a calm mind recharge, go for a cold shower instead.
